# Generating CSV from SQL

This guide explains how to generate a CSV file from an SQL file using the `awk` command. This process can be helpful when you need to extract data from an SQL dump and convert it into a CSV format.

## Prerequisites

- A terminal or command prompt.
- Access to the SQL file you want to convert.
- `awk` installed on your system (usually pre-installed on Unix-like systems).

## Steps

1. **Open a Terminal**: Open a terminal or command prompt on your system.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory containing your SQL file. For example:

    ```bash
    cd /Users/sohitkumar/Desktop/
    ```

3. **Run the `awk` Command**: Use the following `awk` command to extract data from the SQL file and save it as a CSV file:

    ```bash
    awk '/COPY public\.registry_region \(id, name\) FROM stdin;/{flag=1;next}/\\./{flag=0}flag' registry_region_data.sql > registry_region_data.csv
    ```

    - Replace `registry_region_data.sql` with the name of your SQL file.
    - Replace `registry_region_data.csv` with the desired name for your CSV file.

4. **Verify the CSV File**: Check the directory for the generated CSV file (`registry_region_data.csv` in this example). You can open it with a text editor or spreadsheet software to verify that the data has been converted correctly.

## Conclusion

You have successfully generated a CSV file from an SQL file using the `awk` command. This can be useful for various data transformation and analysis tasks.

Remember to adapt the file paths and names as needed for your specific setup.
